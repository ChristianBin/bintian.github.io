ABSTRACT: Optical backbone networks are critical infrastructure for modern digital societies, supporting not only high-volume data transmission but also the security, stability, and continuity of essential services such as healthcare, finance, and emergency response. By enabling seamless connectivity, they underpin the daily operations of households, businesses, and governments, making their security and resilience a matter of broad public concern. Optical backbone networks are characterized by high bandwidth, long-haul transmission, and strong resilience, which require effective solutions for routing and wavelength assignment (RWA), regenerator planning, and protection mechanism design. However, few studies have addressed the integrated optimization of these problems, which presents significant complexity in large-scale networks. Motivated by the urgent demand from industry collaborators for high network reliability, which directly impacts the security and continuity of critical communications services, this paper investigates the integrated regenerator planning and RWA under link failures (RP-RWA-LF) problem. The study aims to ensure 100% network survivability by planning backup lightpaths for possible single-link failures while minimizing costly regeneration. We formulate the RP-RWA-LF problem as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model and prove its NP-hardness. To exactly solve this challenging problem, we develop an efficient branch-and-price-and-check approach, which decomposes the problem into a restricted master problem (RMP) that relaxes wavelength conflict constraints, pricing subproblems that generate backup lightpaths, and feasibility subproblems that check wavelength assignments. Our method is evaluated through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and generated network instances. Results on real-world networks show that the optimal solutions obtained by our
approach reduce regenerator costs by approximately 90% compared to current industry practices. The majority of generated instances are solved optimally, providing valuable insights into regenerator instillation, problem difficulty, and the impact of network parameters.
