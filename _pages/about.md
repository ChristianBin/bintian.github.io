I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Operations Management under the supervision of Prof. [Kai Pan](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lms/people/academic-staff/kai-pan) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/).

Prior to PolyU, I received my bachelor's degree in Logistics Management from the [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2017 and my master's degree in Logistics Engineering from [Shandong University](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2020.

My research primarily centers on discrete, stochastic, and data-driven optimizations, including their applications in power systems, shared-mobility systems, and optical networks. I am now on the job market.
